## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile!

I'm **Karlo**, and I like learning new things, especially tech-related stuff. I enjoy reading random topics, watching interesting content, or playing video games â€“ anything that captures my curiosity. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me doing one of those things.

Currently, I'm working as a **Junior Web Developer** at **Valenin**.

Feel free to connect with me! I enjoy talking to people, exchanging ideas, and learning from others.
